changes in 1.7

handle input argsToDict function:
	added try except clause to deal with cases like:
	    python GEDIT.py -mix FileA.txt -ref FileB.txt -out
	where an error was caused previously looking past bounds of arglist

added EasyRun.sh script for easy usage, and edited readme and sample commands

created scripts/ subdirectory, and moved all python and R scripts there
	goal is to keep main directory clean to avoid user
	confusion/overwhelming

------------------------------------------------------------
changes in 1.6

HandleInput Line 92:
	caused error when elements of row are float instead of string; added inline
	list converting each element to string, needs to be tested.
	Perhaps also be better to exclude, run anyway and throw warning?

Made change so that GLMDECON works on (including 1)
	May want to double check for V1.7

Now allows the user to specify output file using -out

Will now work when run from any directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.5 

normmix and ref outputted include all genes, including those not shared

Include genes that have 0 expression in all mixtures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.4

Matrix Tools:
   line 32 was:    labelled2[i] = [py_mat1[i][0]] + labelled2[i]
   corrected to:   labelled2[i] = [py_targetMat[i][0]] + labelled2[i]

Make parameter input of form -ref ___ -mix ___ ...
	Made changes to HandleInput to do this
        Also changes to top of GEDIT

Numpy Scientific notation bug
	fixed by converting numpy mat to python mat before adding labels back (matrix tools line 26 - 32)

better if the heatmap is flipped the other way?
done

Add output of signature genes, labelled by tissue
      special signature mode for non-split genes (1.4 at earliest)

output file should have top left corner filled

test robustness of input with/without top left corner?


----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.3

Make parameter input of form -ref ___ -mix ___ ...

Add output of signature genes, labelled by tissue
       special signature mode for non-split genes (1.4 at earliest)

output file should have top left corner filled

test robustness of input with/without top left corner?

when Tenx immune ran with sample mix, get error re can't interpret 9.999e^x as a float

better if the heatmap is flipped the other way?
