the 0_RunAll.sh script runs each of the 4 tools present here* on each of the 3
datasets present in ../Inputs/Mixes. It does this once for each of 4 choices
 of reference matrices (../Inputs/RefMats/). Certain R and python packages are
necessary, depending on the tool. 

Cibersort takes a long time to run for the larger reference datasets (HPCA and Blueprint)


*this is excluding xCell, which was run through the online interface
