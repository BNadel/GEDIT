HandleInput Line 92:
	caused error when elements of row are float instead of string; added inline
	list converting each element to string, needs to be tested.
	Perhaps also be better to exclude, run anyway and throw warning?

Made change so that GLMDECON works on (including 1)
	May want to double check for V1.7

Now allows the user to specify output file using -out

Will now work when run from any directory
