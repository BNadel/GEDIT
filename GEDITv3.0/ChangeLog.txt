Changes to 3.0

Code has been ported to python3. print and division statements have been modified as necessary. Tested on a variety of inputs and settings, and output was identical in all cases

-------------------------------------------------
Changes from 2.1 to 2.2

The tool will now run on machines that do not have the statistics package installed, so long as the z-score signature gene selection method is not selected

Specifically, the "import statistics" command in "getSigGenesModal.py" was moved into the portion of code that runs if the "Zscore" signature; this is the only part of the code that uses statistics, anyway

--------------------------
Changes from 2.0 to 2.1

README was outdated, I have updated

Added dendrogram = "none" to VisualizePredictions.R, such that it no longer throws a warning

using the argument --out will now redirect the output to the indicated file; previously this only worked with --outFile, now it works with either

the unused function "genScores" has been removed from getSigGenesModal.py. The
work this function used to do had been migrated to other functions several versions ago

the argument -saveFiles now defaults to writing the signature gene matrix to
the same location as the predictions matrix. Specifying --SaveFiles none will
cancel this, whereas specifying --SaveFiles all will also write the 


------------------------------------------------------------------
changes in 1.7

handle input argsToDict function:
	added try except clause to deal with cases like:
	    python GEDIT.py -mix FileA.txt -ref FileB.txt -out
	where an error was caused previously looking past bounds of arglist

added EasyRun.sh script for easy usage, and edited readme and sample commands

created scripts/ subdirectory, and moved all python and R scripts there
	goal is to keep main directory clean to avoid user
	confusion/overwhelming

------------------------------------------------------------
changes in 1.6

HandleInput Line 92:
	caused error when elements of row are float instead of string; added inline
	list converting each element to string, needs to be tested.
	Perhaps also be better to exclude, run anyway and throw warning?

Made change so that GLMDECON works on (including 1)
	May want to double check for V1.7

Now allows the user to specify output file using -out

Will now work when run from any directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.5 

normmix and ref outputted include all genes, including those not shared

Include genes that have 0 expression in all mixtures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.4

Matrix Tools:
   line 32 was:    labelled2[i] = [py_mat1[i][0]] + labelled2[i]
   corrected to:   labelled2[i] = [py_targetMat[i][0]] + labelled2[i]

Make parameter input of form -ref ___ -mix ___ ...
	Made changes to HandleInput to do this
        Also changes to top of GEDIT

Numpy Scientific notation bug
	fixed by converting numpy mat to python mat before adding labels back (matrix tools line 26 - 32)

better if the heatmap is flipped the other way?
done

Add output of signature genes, labelled by tissue
      special signature mode for non-split genes (1.4 at earliest)

output file should have top left corner filled

test robustness of input with/without top left corner?


----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.3

Make parameter input of form -ref ___ -mix ___ ...

Add output of signature genes, labelled by tissue
       special signature mode for non-split genes (1.4 at earliest)

output file should have top left corner filled

test robustness of input with/without top left corner?

when Tenx immune ran with sample mix, get error re can't interpret 9.999e^x as a float

better if the heatmap is flipped the other way?
